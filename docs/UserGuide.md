> **:information_source: Notes about the command format:**
> 
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
> e.g. in `add n/NAME i/NRIC g/GENDER d/DOB p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `n/John Doe`.
>
> * Items in square brackets are optional.
>  e.g `edit NRIC [n/NAME] [i/NRIC] [g/GENDER] [d/DOB] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]` can be used as `edit S1234567A n/John Lim g/M` or as `edit S1234567A g/M`.
>
> * Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times.
>  e.g. `c/CONDITION…` can be used as, `c/Knee Pain`, `c/Flu c/Fever` etc.
>
> * Parameters that have a prefix can be in any order.
> e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
>
> * Parameters that have no prefix must follow the specified order in the command format.
> e.g. if the command specifies `NRIC n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `NRIC` must take precedence over `n/NAME` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER`.
> 
> * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
> e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
>
> * The command name and prefixes are case-sensitive.
> e.g. `add` is not the same as `Add`, `c/` is not the same as `C/`.
>
> * If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
